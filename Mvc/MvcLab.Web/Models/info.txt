no initialization of collections in the user view models classes. that is done in the 
data layer entities classes , and then mapped over for use in the corresponding model view
classes. the model view classes also contain all the annotations and requirements that are for 
example visible to the user when he enters forms etc, and the labels show error messages and requirements
for how user is supposed to enter in the information. in the entity classes its different, these classes contain
no annotations like the model view classes do. these classes instead have the collection initizlisers in the
constructors, and also have the virtual keyword for the navigation properties for lazy loading. so this
is a great way to decouple these entity and model view classes, which in essence are the same.
